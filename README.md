### ðŸš€ About Me

I am passionate about building robust and scalable solutions. My professional background has allowed me to work with technologies like **Java** and **Kotlin** for building strong applications, and with **Jetpack Compose** and **React** to create modern and responsive user interfaces.

Currently, I'm exploring the world of **Web3** and the **Ethereum** ecosystem. This is an incredibly exciting space, and I'm focused on understanding how blockchain technology can transform how we interact with applications and data.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Web3 Goals

My main goal is to become a professional Ethereum developer. I am committed to:

* Learning the fundamentals of smart contract programming.
* Mastering languages like **Solidity**.
* Contributing to open-source projects within the Web3 ecosystem.
* Building functional and secure decentralized applications (dApps).

I'm building my portfolio here on GitHub to document my progress and projects. Feel free to follow my journey!
